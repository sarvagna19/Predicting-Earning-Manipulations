# Predicting-Earning-Manipulations

Problem : 
Unreliable accuracy
Tricky to train the model
Treating fraudulent cases as noiseÂ 
Solution :
Re-sampling techniques
Modify existing Algorithms
Penalizing the model

Strategy behind Adopting logistic regression
1. Specify Performance Requirements
2. Separate Prediction Algorithm From Model Coefficients
   2a. Select or Implement The Prediction Algorithm
   2b. Serialize Your Model Coefficients
Develop Automated Tests For Your Model
4. Develop Back-Testing and Now-Testing Infrastructure
Challenge Then Trial Model Updates
